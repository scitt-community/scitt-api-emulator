# Testing the SCITT Emulator with Postman

- [Install Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- [Install Newman](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003703325-How-to-install-Newman)

We will need to install some extra newman commands as well:

```sh
npm install -g newman  newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

Run this command from this directory:

```sh
./run-sanity.sh
```
